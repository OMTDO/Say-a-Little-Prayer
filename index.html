        <title>Faith Begins With Thoughts</title>

        <h1>"Hope you know how wonderful you are!"</h1>
        <p>Tonight as I sit here pondering, I am reminded of someone who possesses the faith of Nephi. When confronted with the entire ocean, Nephi simply said, "If the Lord had commanded me to do all things, I could do them."
        </p>
        <p>I remember so cearly one of your most attactive characteristics. It is your simple faith. It used to frusterate me when I felt the weight of some seemingly huge problem like an insurmoutable mountain sit upon my shoulders, but with missionary faith you would simply say, "Quick, say a little prayer." It was your answer to every problem and every challenge I faced in those sometimes dark, and sleepless nights.  I used to feel frusterated, like you were not listening or understanding me, just how big my problems were to me. I have come to learn just the oposite is true. You were teaching me how small my problems were in contrast to the mighty power of God.</p>
        <h3>The Lord's Promise</h3>
        <p>Enos "cried unto [God] continually, for he had said unto me: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye shall receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it.‚Äù (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=15#p15">Enos1:15</a>; italics added.)</p>
        <h3>The Adversary's Counter to This Promise</h3>
        <p>Of course the adversary does not what us to belive or tap into such a promise. So he says, "Believe it not." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng#p13">Moses 5:13)</a></p>
        <p>The question for each of us is which voice will we listen to?</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Ask and ye shall receive</li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4?lang=eng&id=7#p7">(D&C 4:7)</a>
                <li>Believe it not</li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=13#p13">(Moses 5:13)</a>
        </ul>

        <h3>Two Lines That are ALWAYS Lies</h3>
        <p>There are two lines that run through my mind regularly, infact, just this week on several occassions. I have come to know that these two sentences are always lies and are sent for by the father of lies. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=18#p18">(2 Ne.2:18)</a>
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>"I can't."</li>
                <li>"You're all alone on this one."</li>
            </ol>
            <hr/>
            <h3>I CAN'T</h3>
            <p>To this the prophet Nephi boldly declared with faith:</p> 
            <p>
                "If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them. If he should command me that I should say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I should say it, it would be done."<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng#p50">(1 Ne. 17:50)</a>
            </p>

            <hr />
            <h3>YOU'RE ALL ALONE ON THIS ONE</h3>
            <p>
                To this second lie the adversary uses so regularly, we see he is striking again at a common chink in our armor. In the lie above, "I can't" he is actually saying in a hidden way, "Christ won't help you."
            </p>
            <p>
                Now as he tells us "you're all alone", he is actually again saying, "Chirst doesn't care about you. He won't help you. You've got to do this all on your own."
            </p>
            <p>
                The two lies--simple and innocent enough at first glance--are actually full fledged attacks on the integrity of the Lord, and seek to destroy our faith in Him, His power, and His loving and kind help.
            </p>
            <p>
                So if you're all alone is the lie, what is the truth? Christ Himself answers this one:
            </p>
            <p>
                "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you."<a href="https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng#p18">(John 14:18)</a>
            </p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone?lang=eng#p18"><img src="./assets/images/Savior.webp"></a>
            <p>Click the picture above for an incredible talk by Sheri Dew.</p>
            <p>What an incredible promise! So the truth is, we are never alone, and we "can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth [us]."<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philip/4?lang=eng#p13">(Phil.4:13)</a> "For with God, nothing shall be impossible."<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/1?lang=eng#p37">(Luke 1:39)</a></p>

            <h3>You Just Gotta Believe</h3>
        <p>Like Elder Holland told Brother Richardson, and Brother Richardson told me so long ago, "You've just gotta beleive. You've just gotta believe."</p>
        <p>
            Belief is a choice. It is being master of your thoughts rather than allowing your thoughts to master you. It is the ultimate exercise of agency and it the battle field on which most agency related wars are started. Each moment we are confronted with promises and assurances of the Holy Ghost, and loud counterattackes against our faith in the Lord's promises by the adversary.
        </p>
        <p>
            So the question we have to ask ourself is how will we direct our thoughts? Which voice will we chose to believe? "Ask and ye shall receive. I will not leave you comfortles. For with God all things are possible." Or "You're on your own on this one. You're gonna fail." "I can 't do this."
        </p>

        <h2>Say a little prayer</h2>
        <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1991/04/the-power-of-prayer?lang=eng#title1"><img src="./assets/images/Pray.webp" alt="A woman praying"><A woman praying></a>
        <p>
            That childlike faith of my RM best friend that once so irritated me and seemed to belittle the challenges that loomed over my head, now serve as an abolute inspriation to me. It seems that God has always told us, "By small and simple things (as small and simple as prayer) are great things brought to pass."
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng#p6">(Alma 37:6)</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            So, when all devil breaks loose and it seem all is lost, that you can't, and you are all alone. There is deep inside you a simple child-like faith so powerful, it has the capcity to unlock literally the power of the universe. Listen to the faith of that part of you and "say a little prayer." 
        </p>

        <h3>I hope you know, and can rember, what the adversary is trying so hard to kill in you--the knowledge of just how power your simple faith is and just how wonderful you are. I truly hope you know how wonderful you are.</h3>
